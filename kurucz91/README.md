# Kurucz Models

This directory contains the kurucz models in an ascii format that is suitable for use
with Python.  

kurucz91.ls is the file that must be read by  Python to use the disate set 

The files were created from original ascii files (in Kurucz's format).

The units are converted to be identical those calculated with Tlusty/Synspec, 
e.g ergs/cm**2/s/A, and the normalization should be identical.
