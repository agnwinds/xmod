This is a set of models calculated using Synspec from Kurucz and Hubeny/TLUSTY model atmospheres.

The Kurucz models run from log g 0-5, and T 4000-50000. They can be used using the model file kurucz_d14.ls.

The TLUSTY models run from log g 0-9 and T 4000-150000. They can be used using the model file tlusty_d14.ls.

A Hybrid model can be used in which up to T=50000K you use Kurucz, and beyond that you use TLUSTY. To run this,
use kur_tlusty_hybrid.ls.
